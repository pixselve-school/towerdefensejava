A project by Mael KERICHARD and Romain BRIEND realized for the final project of Object Programming class of the
University of Rennes 1

## ‚≠ê Getting started

The game includes two levels to try out the game. When you have played enough to be good at it, you can try to build
your levels using a `.lsd` file or with the intuitive level editor.

## üó∫ Creating a new level

Use the level editor accessible on the home screen. To get more
control, [read the `.lsd` specification sheet](levelSpecification.md) and build your levels from the ground up.
